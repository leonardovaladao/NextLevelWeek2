## A simple student-teacher platform
 A simple app, where teachers can register their classes and insert their phone numbers, so students can contact them. Technologies used:

- ReactJS
- React Native
- Node.js

The app was created in Next Level Week 2, an event by RocketSeat.
The application works this way: A teacher insert their information in the web version of the app. Once this is done, the information is stored in a database. Once this happens, the database sends information when the user clicks on the "Estudar" button. A search application shows all teacher available for a certain subject, day, and hour. In the mobile version, the inscription is not available, only working to list all teachers available, with an extra function: To favorite certain teachers.
